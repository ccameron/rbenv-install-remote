# rbenv-install-remote

rbenv-install-remote is a [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)
and [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv) plugin that hooks into
`rbenv install` command to download and install remote build definitions.

## Installation

There's currently no official support for hooking into `rbenv-install`, [I've
sent a patch](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/pull/201) that will
allow for this plugin to work out of the box and meanwhile you'll have to use
the [hooks-support branch](https://github.com/fgrehm/ruby-build/tree/hooks-support)
from my fork of the project in order for this plugin to work.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.rbenv/plugins
    $ cd ~/.rbenv/plugins
    $ git clone git://github.com/fgrehm/ruby-build.git -b hooks-support

If you already have ruby-build installed as a rbenv plugin, you can just checkout
the hooks-support branch from my fork.

    $ cd ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
    $ git remote add fgrehm git://github.com/fgrehm/ruby-build.git
    $ git fetch fgrehm && git checkout fgrehm/hooks-support

Now that you have ruby-build with hooks enabled, installing rbenv-install-remote
as an rbenv plugin will allow you to use `rbenv install` with remote build
definitions.

    $ mkdir -p ~/.rbenv/plugins
    $ cd ~/.rbenv/plugins
    $ git clone git://github.com/fgrehm/rbenv-install-remote.git

## Usage

As this plugin will only hook into `ruby-build` and download the custom definition
before building, please refer to [ruby-build](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build)
to find out its supported parameters. With `rbenv-install-remote` you'll be able
to:

    $ rbenv install https://raw.github.com/gist/my-ruby-version

And if everything goes fine, this will provide a `my-ruby-version` for use
with rbenv.

If you wanna know more about custom definitions, see the [ruby-build built-in
definitions](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build/tree/master/share/ruby-build)
as a starting point for custom definition files.

### Known definitions

These 2 definitions will allow you to install REE on Ubuntu 12.04 with the patch
that will enable tcmalloc support so that you won't have to use
`CONFIGURE_OPTS="--no-tcmalloc"` when running `rbenv install`.

If you have a custom definition to share, please send me the link or a pull request
adding it to the list above ;)
